/**
 * For `text/*` requests Express doesn't give us a native way to retrieve data out of the payload
 * without using the `body-parser` middleware so we need to workaround it and access that obtain
 * that data ourselves.
 *
 * For `application/vnd.api+json` types of requests, Express doesn't recognize them as being JSON,
 * resulting in `req.body` being empty. Frustratingly enough `req.is('json')` also doesn't work so
 * we need to do our own check to look if it's got `+json` and then surface that potential JSON
 * payload accordingly.
 *
 * And if you can believe it or not, Express also doesn't process `x-www-form-urlencoded` payloads
 * into `req.body` for us without the `body-parser` middleware.
